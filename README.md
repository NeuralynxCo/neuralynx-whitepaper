# NEURALYNX

NEURALYNX is a research-stage Layer-1 blockchain focused on preventive security
and long-term network stability.

## Core principle
Artificial intelligence is used strictly as a **passive security sensor**, not as an authority.
All consensus and state transitions remain fully deterministic and verifiable on-chain.

## Status
- Technical whitepaper completed
- Protocol design phase
- Implementation work has not started yet

## Scope
This repository currently contains research material and protocol specifications.
It is not production-ready software.
