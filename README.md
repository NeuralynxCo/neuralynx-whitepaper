# NEURALYNX

NEURALYNX is a research-stage Layer-1 blockchain focused on preventive security
and long-term network stability.

## Core principle

Artificial intelligence is not used as an authority and never makes consensus or
state transition decisions.

Instead, the AI layer provides **context-dependent cryptographic entropy**
(similar to a transponder-based challenge mechanism) that is used to harden
transactions against replay, correlation, and coordinated attacks.

The AI does **not** interpret transaction contents and does **not** have access
to private data. Transaction confidentiality is preserved end-to-end between
sender and receiver, while all consensus rules and state transitions remain
fully deterministic and verifiable on-chain.

## Status
- Technical whitepaper completed
- Protocol design phase
- Implementation work has not started yet

## Scope
This repository currently contains research material and protocol specifications.
It is not production-ready software.
